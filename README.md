Hey there, according to [this site](https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-many-coding-languages-are-there/#:~:text=How%20Many%20Computer%20Languages%20Are,languages%2C%20including%20esoteric%20coding%20languages) there are over 800 programming languages in the world, and i'm even more sure that they all have a code to say `Hello world!` as every language does, **duh**.

So i made this repl, lets see in how many languages we can say Hello world!.

Please share your code on how to do so in the comments, and also the command on how to run that file if possible. Thanks!

Also, please upvote and share so more people see this and we can reach a huge amount of languages!
